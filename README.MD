# Snake Reinforced

This project is a classic Snake game in which the player's role is taken over by an AI. Using Deep Q Learning algorithms, the AI learns to play the game and achieve higher scores.

## Description

Snake AI is a Python-based game developed using the Pygame framework. 
The game features a snake that moves around the screen, aiming to eat food and 
grow in length. The player's objective is to control the snake's movements 
indirectly through an AI agent. 
The AI is trained using Deep Q Learning, a reinforcement 
learning algorithm that enables it to learn the optimal actions to take 
in different game scenarios.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame
- PyTorch

The game itself is implemented using Python, leveraging the Pygame library for graphical rendering and user input handling. PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, is utilized for creating and training the artificial intelligence agent.

## Getting Started

To get started with Snake AI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/OldSinner/Snake-Reinforced.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system. You can install PyTorch by running:

   ```shell
   pip install torch
   pip install torchvision
   pip install mathplotlib
   pip install numpy
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Once the repository is cloned and the dependencies are installed, navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd SnakeReinforced
   ```

4. Run the game:

   ```shell
   python main.py
   ```

5. Sit back and watch the AI snake in action! You can observe how it learns and improves its performance over time.
